        <h4>// The Mission</h4>
        <p>The goal of the Dragon Runner project was to design and develop a fast-paced 2D platformer game using the Godot Engine within a tight three-week deadline.
             The game needed to provide responsive controls, enjoyable level design, and a visually appealing pixel art style, while offering an accessible but challenging gameplay experience. 
             The primary problem solved was creating smooth, consistent player movement and jump mechanics that feel natural and satisfying for players.</p>
        
        <h4>// My Role</h4>
        <p>I was fully responsible for the game development cycle, which included designing the game concept, coding the core mechanics such as player movement, jumping, and collision detection, as well as building the levels.
             I also handled UI design and game state management, including the win and lose conditions. Additionally, I integrated sound effects and refined the user experience.</p>
        
        <h4>// Intel</h4>
        <p>Tone of the main challenges was achieving fluid jump physics and ensuring consistent collision responses across different platforms in the game. Initially, the player jump felt too "heavy" and the controls were not responsive enough.
             I overcame this by iterating on the physics parameters and fine-tuning the gravity, jump speed, and acceleration to create a more polished and enjoyable movement system. 
             Another challenge was managing time efficiently to complete the project within three weeks, which I solved by setting clear development milestones and sticking to a focused scope.</p>

        <h4>// The Mission</h4>
        <p>The Angker project aimed to create a 2D survival horror multiplayer game for up to four players. Inspired by games like Cleaning Simulator but with a unique horror twist, the goal was to design a cooperative gameplay experience where players must complete cleaning tasks in haunted environments while avoiding and surviving supernatural threats. The challenge was to balance task-based objectives with suspenseful multiplayer interactions, ensuring the game is both thrilling and fun.</p>
        
        <h4>// My Role</h4>
        <p>I led the development of Angker, focusing on multiplayer integration using the Godot Engine and Hathora for dedicated server architecture. I designed core gameplay mechanics, including player movement, task completion. Additionally, I developed the multiplayer synchronization system to ensure smooth real-time interaction among four players. I also handled the user interface, game flow, and horror atmosphere design, including sound effects and visual feedback.</p>
        
        <h4>// Intel</h4>
        <p>One of the toughest challenges was implementing real-time multiplayer with smooth synchronization, especially managing latency and keeping player states consistent across all clients. I addressed this by learning and applying concepts of client prediction and server reconciliation, using Hathora to host a dedicated server. Another significant hurdle was balancing the horror tension with fun gameplay; patterns and speed to keep the game scary but still achievable for players. Time management and scope control were also key, as building both the core gameplay and the multiplayer system within a reasonable timeline required disciplined planning and prioritization.</p>
